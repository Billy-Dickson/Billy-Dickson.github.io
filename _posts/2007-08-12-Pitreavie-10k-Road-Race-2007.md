Just finished "The Pitreavie AAC Forth Bridge 10K", this is the second time I've competed in this race, it was hard work but well worth the effort. Going by my running watch I did it in approximately 42 minute, I'll know more when the results come out this week.

There was a postal strike at the time, so everyone got a home made number.
