## Preamble

The [Alloa Half Marathon](https://www.alloahalfmarathon.co.uk/) is one of my favorite half marathons of the year, and usually the first one in my diary, I missed running it last year through injury, so I was readly happy to be fit enough to run it this year. Although, I'm still lacking speed and endurance just now, I'm hoping that will return with better structured training further in the year.
