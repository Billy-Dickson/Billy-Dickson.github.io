Finished work at five and popped down to [City Cafe](https://www.thecitycafe.co.uk) for some food (chilli beef nachos, Yum!) had a few drinks before meeting up with [Danny (GigAntics)](https://gig-antics.live) at around 7ish. We had  a good old chat before headed off to the gig at around 8ish as we wanted to catch the support band (Bucky Rage).

Who doesn't love noisy fuzzy guitar with a good backbeat, both bands reminded me of older proto-punk/rockabilly bands I’ve seen back in the day, anyway, I hope to see them when they happen to be near my neck of the woods in the future.

The Monsters Bandcamp Bio.

> The Monsters where formed in 1986 in Bern, capital of Switzerland. Their sound is a fuzzedout mix between 60ies garage punk, wild teenage trash rockabilly and primitive rock‘n‘roll. Its 187% no MTV and top 100 shit!
> The Monsters are a kick-ass live band who will burn every stage down. Over the years The Monsters recorded 7 albums, several singles and EP's and appeared on countless compilations.

Both bands were awesome and a good time was certainly had. Being from Scotland, I just love the name Bucky Rage!
