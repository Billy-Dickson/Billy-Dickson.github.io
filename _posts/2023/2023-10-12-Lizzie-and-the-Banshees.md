## Thoughts

I remember seeing [Siouxsie and the Banshees](https://linktr.ee/siouxsieandthebanshees) back in my early 20 at the Playhouse  Edinburgh and they were totally awsome! At the time there was no other band that sounded or looked like them, and I  was totally up for it. Years later as my musical taste matured, I was more into Rock, Metal and Thrash, but I always had a soft spot for the darker stuff.

Last year I managed to see the covers band Lizzie and the Banshees with my mates, [Danny](https://www.gig-antics.live/), Ross and Mark and I really enjoyed it. I even managed to remember some of the Lyrics to the original songs, just as well everyone was singing along. It was also fab bumping into some old friends [Marissa Gray (Nee-Quarta)](https://www.facebook.com/marisa.gray.5) and [Alison Thompson](https://www.facebook.com/alison.thomson.313) from our partying days at the nightclub **The Backroom** later re-named to  [**The Mission**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/178065414199) in Edinburgh.
