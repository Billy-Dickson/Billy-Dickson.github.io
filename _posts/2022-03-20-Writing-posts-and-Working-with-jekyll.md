You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')

=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

This is more of a reminder for me, but feel free to use them if it's helpful. I'm currently in the process of converting my old Wordpress site to Jekyll.

#### Useful Markdown and Jekyll Links

* Wordpress addon called [Wordpress Jekyll Explorer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/) that I'm going to try and use to export my old Wordpress Site to a Jekyll.
* Here is a helpful links that describe a number of options for converting WordPress to [Jekyll](https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll). I'll update these link as then try them, at the moment they are a reminder to myself.
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for Github and Jekyll
