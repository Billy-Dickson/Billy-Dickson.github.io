## My thoughts on the race

I love this race, I would describe it as undulating (ok, a bit hilly) and it happens to be the first longer run of the running season for me. I've ran it a number of times over the years either solo or with my sister and I love how well it's organised, the spread at the end is excellent as well.

Big shout out to [Lasswade Althletic Club](https://www.facebook.com/LasswadeAC1981) for organising such a fab race.
