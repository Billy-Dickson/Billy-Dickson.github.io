The original plan was to support number on niece on her first marathon, she was running her first marathon to raise money for [Maggie’s Centres](https://www.maggies.org/our-centres/). No real plan or finishing time planned, just a wee trot round at a fairly easy pace while supporting her and her friends (as it was, she smashed it as me and sis expected).

I ended up running with one her friends who was struggling a bit at mile 16 with cramp, so I slowed down and ran with her for a 5-6 miles. She perked up at mile 21 and assured me that all was good, so I hoofed it to the finish line in the hope of catching up with number one niece.

As they say in Scotland “The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft agley” – [Robert Burns - To a Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse) -  1785

This was my 5th Edinburgh Marathon and I really did enjoy it, the only fly in the ointment was the mental weather, we had sunshine, rain, hailstones and horrendous wind and different point in the race.
