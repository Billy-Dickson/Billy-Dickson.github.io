It was a fabulous opportunity to be able to run the Virgin London Marathon, times below. I’m going to take a week off and just relax, maybe next week I’ll do a little work at the gym (probably cardiovascular), I think I’ll give my legs a rest for the full 2 weeks before starting to run again.
I more please with raising money for [Marie Curie Cancer Care](https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/) who are a fabulous bunch of guys, I would certainly run for them again given the chance.

## Memorable Moments

1. Running over Tower bridge
2. The whole atmosphere, which was just magical
3. Spending time with my Uncle Michael and Auntie Anna who I don't see often.
4. Spending time with my my very pregnant wife who did brilliantly getting around
