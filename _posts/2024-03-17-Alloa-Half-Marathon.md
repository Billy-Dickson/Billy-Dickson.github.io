The [Alloa Half Marathon](https://www.alloahalfmarathon.co.uk/) is one of my favorite half marathons of the year, and usually the first one in my diary, I missed running it last year through injury, so I was really happy to be fit enough to run it this year. Although, I'm still lacking speed and endurance at the mo, I'm hoping that, with a better structured training plan, I'll get faster and fitter later in the year.
