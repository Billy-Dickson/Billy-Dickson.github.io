## Preamble

Although, I've only got a few photos of this one, it's one that I really did enjoy. It's advertised as Britain's most beautiful marathon, and the scenery really is stunning. Itâ€™s also fairly hardcore and Iâ€™m glad that I did the right amount of training, which included hills, otherwise I would have really  struggled. I  had a chat with someone at the start line (another runner) who assured us, that if we added an hour to our PB (Personal Best), I would be doing well, as it happens, my finishing time was only about 30 minutes outside my PB, so I was fairly happy with that.

After our usual discussion about it in the pub one night, myself and Chris planned to run it together. But as it happened, Chris was a bit injured and didnâ€™t manage to get enough training in, and being the sensible person he is, decided not to run. Being a good mate, he did however run me down in his car, as we had already arranged digs down there. He also cheered me off at the start and cheered when I crossed the finish line.

At the finish line, my calves were in tatters, I managed to stretch a bit standing up, I then sat down in the hope of stretch my legs some more. Unfortunately, at that point my calves started to spasm and I had to lie down until that stopped. Thankfully, a lovely lady came over to ask if I needed help, I would imaging she noticed my predicament and being the good Samaritan that she was, offered to help me stand (yep that happened). ðŸ˜€
