## Preamble

I loved visiting Amsterdam, the place is just a great place to visit, being from Scotland and a fairly hilly part of Scotland at that, I found the Marathon more difficult that I was expecting. I suspect it was my choice of routes and not running enough flat long routes that contributed to my discomfort, that and the onset of a cold.

I would still recommend it to anyone considering it as a marathon to run and/or a holiday destination, lovely place!
