If I remember correctly, this ran for 2 years and then was cancelled as they weren't making enough money out of the event.

I ran it the first year it was organised, and a lots of Penicuik Harriers ran it as well as the fab Jane and Yvonne from Penicuik Jogscotland. The route went out, then did 2 loops before finishing. I wasn't happy with the route, as you were running past runners that were about to finish and you had another loop to run, as you can imagine, it was a tad soul destroying. I do remember that the following year they changed the route to avoid this happening, the following year the race was canned.

I don't have any photos of the event, but If any of my friends happen to find any, I'll add them.
