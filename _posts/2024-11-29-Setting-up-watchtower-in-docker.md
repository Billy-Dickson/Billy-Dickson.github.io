With watchtower you can update the running version of your containerized app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker Hub or your own image registry.

## Pre-requisites

1. Working knowledge of Linux
2. Linux box (or virtual machine) with docker already installed

Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing container and restart it with the same options that were used when it was deployed initially.

Watchtower is intended to be used in homelabs, media centers, local dev environments, and similar. Donâ€™t use Watchtower in a commercial or production environment. If that is you, you should be looking into using Kubernetes. If that feels like too big a step for you, please look into solutions like MicroK8s and k3s that take away a lot of the toil of running a Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

See my yaml code below, all of my docker containers reside on a self contained network called **black hole** and are checked for updates at 1:00  every night, when they are updated an email is sent through an old gmail account to my email proper.

The only thing I had to do, was to create an app password for the watchtower email client, you can do this by following the instructions in the this [link here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

![App Password](../assets/img/posts/2024/2024-11-29-Setting-up-watchtower-in-docker/app_password.webp)

```yaml
services:
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    networks:
       - blackhole
    container_name: watchtower
    restart: always

    environment:
      WATCHTOWER_SCHEDULE: "0 0 1 * * *"
      TZ: Europe/London
      WATCHTOWER_INCLUDE_STOPPED: 'true'
      WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP: 'true'
      WATCHTOWER_MONITOR_ONLY: 'false'
      WATCHTOWER_REVIVE_STOPPED: 'false'
      WATCHTOWER_DEBUG: 'false'
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS: email
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM: old_gmail_account@gmail.com
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO: billy@example.com
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER: smtp.gmail.com
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_PORT: 587
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_USER: old_gmail_account@gmail.com
      WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD: "app password created above"

    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

networks:
   blackhole:
    name: blackhole
    external: true
```

Below is an example of the email that's sent when an image is updated.
