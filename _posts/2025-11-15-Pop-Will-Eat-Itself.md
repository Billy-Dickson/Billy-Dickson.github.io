Being a Saturday and having done everything on my families tick list, I had arranged to jump on the same bus to Edinburgh as my compadre [Mr Slash Vaseline](https://www.gig-antics.live/post/introducing-slash-vaseline). We had already prearranged a pre-gig drink with [Danny Gig-Antics](https://www.gig-antics.live) at the [Guilded Saloon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ru3xsXKUpMierPXc7).

I wasn't impressed with the food options, so we headed along the road to the [Paradise Palms](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sJvRwUuFjxGRbE8Y6), FYI their chicken nuggets are fab 🐔 👍. After I was pleasently full, we headed along to La Belle Angele and managed to see the last 2 songs from the GANS and I've got to say, myself [Danny Gig-Antics](https://www.gig-antics.live) and [Slash Vaseline](https://www.gig-antics.live/post/introducing-slash-vaseline) thought they were belters! I'm really going to have to see a whole set next time they are in Edinburgh.

### GANS

A wee snippet in [louderthanwar](https://louderthanwar.com/listen-gans/) by John Robb with the video clip he mentioned, go read it, its well worth it, and I've got to say, the video's a banger!

> We are loving this track from GANS. It’s a genius shouty stomp of a single like a meeting between Insane in the Membrane and the
Sleaford Mods but with guitars. A big bouncing beast of a tune that has a hook line in its kitchen sink drama...
> GANS release a new single I Think I Like You through Strap Originals on Wednesday March 5th. I Think I Like You was produced and
mixed by Ross Orton (Arctic Monkeys, Amyl & The Sniffers, Yard Act, M.I.A, Working Men’s Club, The Fall) in Sheffield in December 2024.

### Pop Will Eat Itself

A little snippet from their Wikipedia page, do feel free to read it in its [entirety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Will_Eat_Itself).

> Pop Will Eat Itself are an English [alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock) rock band formed in 1986 in [Stourbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stourbridge) in the [West Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(region)) of England with members from [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), [Coventry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry) and the [Black Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country). Initially known as a [grebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grebo_(music)) act, they changed style to incorporate [sample-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)) [indie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock) and [industrial rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_rock). Graham Crabb describes their sound as "electronic, punk, alternative hip-hop, hybrid music for fucking, fighting & smoking cigars". Their highest-charting single was the 1993 top-ten hit "Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!".[3] After initially disbanding in 1996, and having a brief reformation in 2005, they issued their first release in more than five years in 2010.
