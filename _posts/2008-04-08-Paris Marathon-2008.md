Having trained faithfully for the last 4 months in all weather, the trip to Paris was filled with anticipation. We arrived on the Friday and proceeded directly to the Marathon Expo not realising how far from the Airport, the Expo was about 2 stops from Euro Disney. Collected our Bib numbers and spent a bit of time looking around the stalls, bought a nice looking Paris Marathon T-shirt and a few other bits and bobs.

On Saturday we did the tourist thing and went up the Eiffel Tower (right to the top), the weather was awful but it was well worth if for the fabulous view. Had some lunch on the Avenue de Champs-Elysees, pasta not surprisingly, did a bit of shopping then dinner, pasta again! got back to the hotel at about 9:00â€™ish got all our gear arranged for the morning and hit the sack at about 10:00.

Set off early in the morning to our local Metro station, as soon as we got there we bumped into our first group of marathon runners, three guys from the Leeds area, one of which was going to be running the Flora London Marathon the following week (nutter!). We all got off at the correct station and bumped into a sea of runners. All we had to do at that point was to join the mass exodus to the next metro.

Myself and Mark ran the first 22 miles together, he needed to use the facilities (toilet break ðŸ™‚ ) so I ran the last 4.2 miles at a slightly faster pace.

## Memoral Moments

1. Running down a tunnel that runs under the river Seine, while listening to all the french runner singing the [La Marseillaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Marseillaise), definitely making memories that day
2. The amazing artwork at [La vouvre](https://www.louvre.fr/en/)
3. The steaks my mum treated us to after the marathon
