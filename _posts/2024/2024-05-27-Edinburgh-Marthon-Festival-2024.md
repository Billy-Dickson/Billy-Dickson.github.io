## Preamble

This run is literally on my doorstep so it would be rude not to, as it happened the day started to rain and didnâ€™t stop all day, so as you can probably image, everyone running the Half Marathon that day was thoroughly soaked from start to finish.

Apparently the organisers of the run, [ran out of medals](https://news.stv.tv/east-central/edinburgh-marathon-runners-fuming-after-organisers-run-out-of-competitor-medals) for the marathon. I think it's totally unacceptable for that to happen, I mean you know how many runners your catering for, at that point it's simple arithmetic?

As it happens, I quite enjoyed the run despite the weather, I might even be tempted to run the full marathon next year, if they get their shit together.
