This Edinburgh Marathon started at Princes Street and finished in Holyrood Park, definitely one of my favourite routes  as it took in some of the best of Edinburgh and finished in Edinburgh, rather than Musselburgh where it finishes these days. I think they should really just call it the Edinburgh to Musselburgh Marathon and be done with it. I do understand that I costs more money to close roads off in Edinburgh, but at the end of the day, it's not all about the money.

Saying that, I’m thankful that I got to run that route and I did really enjoy it.

The weather on the day was about 22c not ideal for running, but that didn’t matter so much when it’s a gloriously sunny day and your getting encouragement by the locals along the way.

I ran first 10 miles or so with my mate Chris, who’s ran a few marathons before and is a bit more knowledgeable than me about important thing like starting pace (thankfully!). I’m going to have to get one of those fancy watches that tell you your average speed, if I’m going to run another marathon I recon (Ok I like gadgets!)
