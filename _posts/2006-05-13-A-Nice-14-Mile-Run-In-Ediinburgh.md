I’m currently in training for the [Edinburgh Marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/marathon) I’m on week 5 and counting down. Quite looking forward to it now, although the long runs are better now since the Scottish weather is improving. This is my second marathon having done the Berlin Marathon last year, of which I really enjoyed (nice and flat). As far as training goes, I’m following a book called “[The Competitive Runners Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140469907/102-5065963-1922532?v=glance&n=283155)” by “Bob Glover and Shelly-Lynn Florence Glover.

I would class myself as a basic competitor so I’m following the training regime on page 249 of the book and what I’ve found while doing the long runs in Edinburgh, is that it’s really quite difficult to work out the mileage using a map and something that's really not needed these days.

What I do is use [The AA’s website](https://www.theaa.com/route-planner/route) and pick a location that I know is roughly half the distance I need to run. Using my home as a start point (my postcode anyway), In my case this week I need to run 14 miles for my long run, so I know that Musselburgh is about 7 miles I put my postcode in the from: part of the route planner, then the town Musselburgh in the to: field tick the box that asks Would you like a map of your route? and it works out all the hard bits for me (see below) it even draws a map for you. Yep I know it’s lazy but hey if it saves time then its a good idea in my book.

| Travel (miles) | and then                                                                                   | to take | total (miles) |
