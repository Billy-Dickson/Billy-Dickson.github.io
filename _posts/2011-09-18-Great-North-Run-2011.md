The Red Arrows flying over the start of the runners was my the best memory of the whole event, It was a brilliant run and given the opportunity, one I would happily run again, the crowd participation was brilliant, with hundreds of people lining the route from start to finish.

After the race, Mark and myself went out for a few beers to celebrate, it was a quiet one as most of the runners seemed to have went home or had an early night, just us diehard Scottish drinkers and some of the younger crowd where out. Still, it was a good laugh and we did manage to catch up with my cousin Stewart for a few beers.
