The [Alloa Half Marathon](https://www.alloahalfmarathon.co.uk/) is one of my favourite half marathons of the year, I was really happy to be fit enough to run it this year, and usually it's the first one in my diary. I'm currently in a training block for the Edinburgh Marathon, so I'm almost race fit and my endurance is getting better.
