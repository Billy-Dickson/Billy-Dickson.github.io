## My thoughts at the time

This [Gardian Article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/03/new-york-marathon-cancellation-decision) kinds of echos my feelings at the time. Although I know it as the right decision, I just wish they had made if earlier. As it is, I've unfinished business with the New York City Marathon and hopefully one of these days, I'll get the chance to run it.

> "The marathon is off!" It was my running mate Gavin, shouting from the other end of the immigration line at JFK airport.
>
> "You're joking," I called back, not entirely convinced. And when I saw the look of a man utterly crushed, contemplating the futility of six months of gruelling training, 5am starts, ice baths and long lonely runs, I knew he wasn't having me on.
>
> As the news rippled down the line of passengers, most of whom were runners or supporters, there was confusion, tears, anger and disappointment. But right then, I didn't know what to think or feel. I just went cold, and then numb.
>
> I had watched the rolling news reports from London of the devastation wreaked by Sandy. I fully expected the marathon would be cancelled â€“ not just out of respect for those whose lives were affected so tragically, but also just for purely logistical reasons. The images being beamed around the world in the hours after the disaster were of the Manhattan skyline plunged into darkness and subway tunnels filling up with water. It seemed impossible that the city could cope with 40,000 people running through its streets at a time of such chaos.
