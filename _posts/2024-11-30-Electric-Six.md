What can I say about this gig, well apart from it was unexpectedly awsome, never having seen them before and being lucky enough to score a free ticket from [Mr Slash Vaseline](https://www.gig-antics.live/post/introducing-slash-vaseline) who was double booked and was in [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges). Lucky me is all I can say, loved their old classics especially Gay Bar and I really enjoyed their version of [Murder On The Dance Floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAx6mYeC6pY) by [Sophie Ellis-Bextor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Ellis-Bextor)

Venue - [The Queens Hall](https://thequeenshall.net)

As [Danny (Gig-Antics)](https://www.gig-antics.live/) and me mentioned on the night, everybody loves Dick ðŸ˜‰ (Valentine) on vocals, doing a grand job, as you can see below.
