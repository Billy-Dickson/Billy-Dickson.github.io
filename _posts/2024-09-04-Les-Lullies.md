I left sharp from work and headed to the [City Restaurant](https://www.thecityrestaurant.co.uk/) for some [grub](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/grab+some+grub), which for me is always a good start to the evening, I had already arranged to meet the guys at [Bannermans](https://www.bannermanslive.co.uk/) for a few early gig libation, and a wee catchup (who doesn't love a wee catchup), It's always good to find out what everyone's been up to in the intervening weeks, family stuff and suggestions for new bands to see usually, but its always a pleasure.

The usual suspect turned up at various times between 7 and 30 past the hour, Chris, Ross, [Mark](hhttps://www.gig-antics.live/post/introducing-penigoth-mark) and [Danny](https://gig-antics.live). After a chat about the main event and the support act, we decided to have another drink and see the tail end of the support band.

I really enjoyed the gig and it was just as well I took the following day off, enjoyable but tiring. üòÄ

## The Band

LES LULLIES don‚Äôt shy away from their influences, but their synthesis of ‚Äô77-style punk with power pop and ‚Äô60s garage rock yields results that are inarguably original.
