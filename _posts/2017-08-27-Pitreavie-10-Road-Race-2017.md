One of the many races that I don't have any photographs of, shame really, because if I remember correctly it was a cracker. Still, I thought I would take an online note of it for posterity, as it looks like I ran it at a reasonably good lick for me. It was a good while ago so no doubt I was younger, possibly slimmer and certainly fitter.
