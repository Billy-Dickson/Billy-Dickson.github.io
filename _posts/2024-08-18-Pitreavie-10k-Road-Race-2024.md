Always a firm favorite with myself and my running buddies and fellow [Harriers](https://penicuikharriers.org.uk/), Itâ€™s an out and back course over the Forth Road Bridge, the spread (food and drink) provided at the end is brilliant! I also had the added bonus of bumping into Dave, our very own Harriers running coach (always a pleasure).

This year I ran it with my sister and my niece, who almost pipped me to the post in a rather spectacular sprint finish. If she runs it again, no doubt she'll beat her old uncle as I'm definitely getting slower ðŸ˜Š
