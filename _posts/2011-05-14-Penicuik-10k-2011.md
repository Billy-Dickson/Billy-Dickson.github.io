This is my local [running clubs](https://penicuikharriers.org.uk/) [10k road race](https://penicuikharriers.org.uk/10k-road-race/) and I really love running it, the years I'm not running it, I'm helping the club marshal it. The course is described as _undulation_, but those in the know would describe it as uphill at the start, especially Pomathorn Road.

However you want to describe it, I always enjoy it and it's a fabulously organised 10k road race.
