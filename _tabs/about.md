# Occupation

I've worked in the Information Technology field for many years, 25 years of which at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk). If you buy me a coffee, and I'll happily tell you all about it.

Would I recommend working in the IT in Academia as of 2022 or after, no probably not, these days it seems to be about "Sweating your assets", "Working Smarter", "Above and Beyond".

Lips service is paid to "Work Life Balance" and "Mental Health" and after talking to some of my old work collegues over a couple of beers, it doesn't seem to have improved any in the intervening 2 years.

I started my new job this year on 7th March 2022, It was definitely time for me to move on, and I'm glad I did.

## Likes

Spending time with friend and socialising, playing pool, travelling and holidays! keeping fit and going to the gym, tinkering about with new technology. I also enjoy reading, Chinese, Thai, India and Italian food.

### Running and Fitness

I started running in 2004 after I stopped smoking, my first full marathon was September 2005. I've since ran 12 Marathons (one was cancelled), numerous Half Marathons and 10K races. I've been a qualified Scottish Athletics [Jogscotland Leader](https://sauser.sportserve.net/pages/home.aspx) since 8th September 2018 and I've really enjoyed helping novice runners reach their full potential, whatever distance they decide to run.

This photo was taken in September 2009 when I ran the Berlin Marathon for a second time. I'm the guy on the left wearing my [St Andrew's Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Scotland) vest.

### IT Technologies

Web Technologies Such as HTML and CSS, Networking and Computer Technologies, I'm currently in in the process of resurrecting my [old blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20180516212904/http://www.dickson.me.uk/) and converting it from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). As of April 2024, I've resurrected my old website in a Proxmox VM, and I'm in the process of combing through it to see if there's anything that I might be worth porting over, some of the technical blog bits are no longer relevant. But I'll probably move over some of the more interesting and relevant bits (when I have time).

### Internet Of Things

I'm currently using a [Hubitat Bridge](https://hubitat.com/), but I'm thinking of moving onto the  [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) ecosystem (after the chip shortage isn't a thing).

I also have an interest in Smart Lighting and Smart Heating using a mobile applications such as Amazon or Google Home for control.

### Music

I’ve got a pretty eclectic taste: 80’s Alternative, Goth, Metal to The Smiths, NIN, The Ramones, Bauhaus, Portishead, [Attrition UK](https://attritionuk.bandcamp.com/) to name but a few. I've played bass guitar in various bands when I was younger and still enjoy playing now and again, either on my own, or jamming with friends.

My current favourites band at the moment are [Amyl and the Sniffers](https://www.amylandthesniffers.com/), feel free to check them out on Youtube if you have the time.
